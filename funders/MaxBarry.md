> Fiction as civic rehearsal—making systems legible to the public.

**Philosophical frame**
Fiction as civic rehearsal: exploring power, systems, and language to reveal failure modes and possibilities.

**Operational fit**
Narrative prototyping; public imagination; translation of complex civics/alignment ideas for broad audiences.

**Benefits / ROI**
- Accessible on-ramps: stories that make governance experiments legible.
- Reputation & reach: draws non-technical audiences into open civics.
- Narrative guardrails: highlights misuse/abuse patterns before they ship.

**Complementarity & synergy**
- With **GovAI/RAND/NIST**: turns policy/standards into human stories.
- With **OpenAI/CHAI/ARC**: probes alignment ethics & edge cases.
- With **OSF/SFF**: amplifies pluralism; mobilizes cultural legitimacy.
