# GitHub

**Philosophical frame**  
Code is civic infrastructure. Open collaboration can govern more than software.

**Operational fit**  
The living repo model maps to governance: issues, pull requests, forks, contributors.

**Benefits / ROI**  
- Trust: every decision is versioned + auditable.  
- Familiar workflows for tech + civic actors.  
- Global contributor base already exists.

**Complementarity & synergy**  
Bridges technical (OpenAI/CHAI), financial (SFF), civic (OSF), and policy (GovAI, RAND, NIST) spheres.  
Backbone environment for *all* exemplars to interact openly.

**Signals / Credibility**  
- Repo: https://github.com/rickballard/CoPolitic  
- Community ethos: https://dogsnhomes.org.uk/
