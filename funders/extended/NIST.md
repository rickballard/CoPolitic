> Complimentary overview based on public materials. No images or personal details; please propose edits via PR if anything should be clarified.

## Public Profile (selected)
- Known for: **Standards & metrics**
- Programs / publications: see references below
- Areas of focus: methods, artifacts, and practices that others can **inspect, reuse, and build upon**

## Civic Relevance
- **Institutional legibility:** produces work that is auditable and citable (papers, code, standards, guidance)
- **Public on-ramps:** invites external critique and collaboration in ways aligned with open governance
- **Signal value:** track record that lowers coordination costs for civic, academic, and industry partners

## Strategic Fit with CoPolitic / CoCivium
- **Benefits:** complementary strengths that balance technical rigor, policy legitimacy, funding stewardship, and cultural narrative
- **Safeguards:** non-partisan, non-coercive; inclusion is complimentary and does not imply coordination
- **Interfaces:** clear “good first issues” for participation (briefs, metrics, disclosures, evaluations)

## Suggested Lightweight Collaborations
- Joint brief or open Q&A on how NIST (U.S.)’s methods translate into **transparent civic workflows**
- Open metrics or evaluations suitable for public replication
- “Good first issue” for contributors: surface terminology, provenance, or disclosure templates
