- Known for: **Alignment experiments**
- Programs / publications: see references below
- Areas of focus: methods, artifacts, and practices that others can **inspect, reuse, and build upon**

## Civic Relevance
- **Institutional legibility:** produces work that is auditable and citable (papers, code, standards, guidance)
- **Public on-ramps:** invites external critique and collaboration in ways aligned with open governance
