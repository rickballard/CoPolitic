# TOS-AI — Transition Office Steward (AI pivots)

**Purpose.** Drive an organization’s AI transition across strategy, governance, and operating model within **1–2 quarters**, then hand back to steady-state owners.

**Why now.** AI workloads create cross-functional risk: assurance gaps, vendor sprawl, policy whiplash. Without a single accountable steward, transitions stall.

## Mandate
- **Strategy** — unify bets; prune duplicative work; align with mission.
- **Governance** — risk, assurance, policy, data handling; guardrails that ship.
- **Operating model** — roles, incentives, and processes that stick post-handoff.

## Exit criteria
- Adopted policies & controls with owners.
- Run-booked processes; metrics and cadences in place.
- De-risked vendor choices; cost & value tracked.
- Decision log closed; residuals accepted.

## Deliverables
- Charter & RACI, decision log, policy pack, playbooks, and a final handback.

> **Neutrality covenant:** CAP stewards **advisory power only**. No sponsor or vendor has control or special access.
