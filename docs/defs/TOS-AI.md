# CoSteward

**Full:** Transition Office Steward – AI pivots  
**Role:** Temporary executive-level steward who guides an organization through AI-related strategy, governance, and operating-model shifts.

**Why not “CoSteward”?**  
Avoids authority/ego conflicts. CoSteward frames a **time-bound transition** with clear accountability.

**Core duties**
- Translate AI strategy into governance, risk, and assurance.
- Orchestrate cross-functional execution and change management.
- Define “exit criteria” that hand back steady-state ownership.

**Former label:** CoSteward *(deprecated)*
