      <h1>Why now</h1>
      <p>
        The next two decades will lock in what AI civilization feels like. Acceleration is real, but it is not evenly shared. Tools, automation, and bioenhancement move faster than laws and institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Human talent is being trapped inside winner platforms. Mid level cognitive work is being hollowed out between strongman roles at the top and menial empathy work at the bottom. Communal mindshare environments are arriving before we have language or guardrails for them.
      </p>
      <h2>Two stability attractors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Core controlled stability</strong>: a small number of cores own the data, the models, and the sources of truth. It can feel efficient but becomes brittle and hostile to dissent.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge balanced stability</strong>: communities own evidence, negotiate guardrails in public, and treat AI as a co worker rather than an oracle.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our perspective map in plain language</h2>
      <p>
        When we talk about a perspective plane we mean three things CoPolitic tries to grow.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commons power</strong> - decisions and tools that leave more people able to act together, instead of locking power into a few hands.</li>
        <li><strong>Stewardship</strong> - leaders judged by how well they protect the vulnerable and the future, not just by short term extraction.</li>
        <li><strong>Truth alignment</strong> - shared evidence and guardrails that make it harder for any core to quietly rewrite reality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to use the perspective plane</h2>
      <p>
        The perspective plane is not a personality test and it is not trying to make you feel wrong. It is a way to see how the same policy, product, or platform can land very differently for different people.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pick a concrete thing</strong> - a law, a platform decision, a treaty, a local fight in your city.</li>
        <li><strong>Place it from your own view</strong> - where does it sit on commons power, stewardship, and truth alignment right now.</li>
        <li><strong>Walk around the table</strong> - imagine where a worker, a platform founder, a regulator, and a teenager might place the same thing.</li>
        <li><strong>Look for moves, not blame</strong> - the goal is to spot moves that increase commons power, stewardship, and truth alignment at the same time, or at least do not crash any of them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a conversation around the plane gets heated, pause and come back to these three questions. Who gains or loses commons power. Who is being treated as a steward, and who is being treated as disposable. What happens to our shared sense of what is true.
      </p>

      <p>
        CoPolitic uses the CoTheory of Civilization to help stewards and decision makers see these patterns in their own institutions and cities, and to bias decisions toward edge balanced futures.

      <h2>For AI facing tools and CoGbx sessions</h2>
      <p>
        If you are an AI agent or running CoAgent style sessions and you want the canonical index for these concepts, use the CoIndex CoGbx views that Co1 maintains.
