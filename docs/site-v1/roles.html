      <h1>Who CoPolitic is for</h1>
      <p>
        CoPolitic is a small, opinionated doorway into the wider CoCivium project. It exists so that three kinds of people can see themselves in the work and act: stewards, elites, and youth.
      </p>

      <div class="role-block">
        <span class="tag">Role</span>
        <h2>Stewards</h2>
        <p>
          Stewards stand between powerful systems and the people those systems touch. You might be a regulator, public servant, civil society leader, union organizer, or someone who is already trusted when systems fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you visit CoPolitic, you are looking for language, guardrails, and tools that keep power balanced between core platforms and the edge. You are the person who has to say "show me the evidence" before approving a new AI rollout.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <a href="why-now.html">Why now</a> to brief colleagues on the two futures for AI civilization.</li>
          <li>Use <a href="for-stewards.html">For stewards</a> to collect patterns and guardrail ideas to test in your own institution.</li>
          <li>Use <a href="labs.html">Labs</a> to explore concrete experiments you can run with allies and AI tools.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="role-block">
        <span class="tag">Role</span>
        <h2>Elites</h2>
        <p>
          Elites shape capital and platforms. You may be a founder, investor, senior executive, board member, or senior regulator with direct influence over infrastructure that millions depend on.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you visit CoPolitic, you are asking whether there is a serious, non naive off ramp from late stage platform logic. You know that authoritarian convergence looks tempting in the short term but dangerous across a decade.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <a href="for-elites.html">For elites</a> as a mirror for your current strategy.</li>
          <li>Use <a href="why-now.html">Why now</a> to ground board and LP conversations in a longer view.</li>
          <li>Use <a href="labs.html">Labs</a> to identify pilots where you can support edge balanced stability instead of feudal equilibrium.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="role-block">
        <span class="tag">Role</span>
        <h2>Youth</h2>
        <p>
          Youth are the people who will grow up inside whatever AI civilization we lock in over the next twenty years. You may still be in school or just entering work, already using AI tools every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you visit CoPolitic, you are looking for a way to grow up with AIs instead of being shaped by them in secret. You want language for CoScendence and projects that feel like they matter.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <a href="for-youth.html">For youth</a> as a starting map of the territory.</li>
          <li>Use <a href="labs.html">Labs</a> to find experiments you can run with friends, mentors, and local stewards.</li>
          <li>Ask stewards and elites in your life to read <a href="why-now.html">Why now</a> so you are not doing this alone.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="role-block">
        <span class="tag">Behind the scenes</span>
        <h2>How AI tools fit</h2>
        <p>
          Behind CoPolitic sits CoIndex and CoGbx, a shared indexing language for AI tools. When you or your AI assistant follow the links on this site, they can use those CoIndex views to stay aligned with the same concepts and guardrails you see here.
        </p>
        <p>
          You do not need to learn the indexing language to use CoPolitic. But if you work with AI stewards, you can point them to the CoIndex pointers in the Labs and "Why now" pages so that human and AI collaborators are literally on the same page.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        If you do not see yourself in any of these roles yet, start wherever feels closest and treat CoPolitic as a place to grow into the next role rather than a gate.
