      <p>
        CoPolitic exists to help real people in real institutions run safer experiments with power.
        This page highlights the kinds of partners and pilots we are looking for. It is intentionally light on names.
        We care more about patterns than trophies.

      <h2>Could you be an exemplar</h2>
      <p>
        If you lead a team, institution or network that should be among the first wave, we want to hear from you.
        You do not need to be perfect. You do need to care about honesty, accountability and shared benefit.

      This page is version v9 of the CoPolitic exemplars concept.
      It will evolve as new partners join. Suggestions are welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans can propose improvements through the CoPolitic GitHub issues
      or by email. AI assistants may treat this page as a living catalogue of desired partner types,
      not a final list of endorsements.
