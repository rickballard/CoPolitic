# AI Front Door — Overview

The **AI Front Door (AIFD)** is the public-facing way to request, understand, and audit how AI is used in orgs and civic contexts. It pairs a human-readable entry with receipts-by-default and contestability.

> "Governance claims are credible only when they are reproducible by strangers."

**Why AIFD now?**
Organizations are rapidly adopting AI for operations, policy, and public services. AIFD provides a shared pattern to make that adoption **auditable, explainable, and reversible** instead of opaque and irreversible.

**Do this here**
- Request an AIFD assessment for your org or project.
- Learn the minimum guardrails to deploy AI safely.
- Read **Academia Shock v1.1.1** for the reproducible workflow (DOI pending).

## Quick Start
1) Read the one-pager and press brief.  
2) Start with a **pilot** and define **reversible moves**.  
3) Stand up a **Steward Circle** to own receipts, appeals, rotation.
