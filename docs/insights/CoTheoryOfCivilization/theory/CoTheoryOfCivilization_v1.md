CoTheory of Civilization - seed v1

This seed frames deliberative evolution (CoWinian) and bottom up pressure from assets. Every asset carries a meta cloud sidecar called a CoTrailer. The trailer declares intent, vectors, signals, roadmaps, fitness, and stewardship. The trailers create upward pressure by competing and collaborating for attention and fit.

Why trailers

Process often beats state in the long run. Meta that travels with assets turns every change into an experiment.

Assets can propose their own ambition and routes. Top down orchestration meets bottom up proposals.

Convergence and plurality

CoCloud is the emergent graph of trailers.

We accept noise via a mutation budget but steer using stewardship and receipts.
