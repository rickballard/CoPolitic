Stewardship — Roles, Mandate, Rituals

Stewards stand between AI systems and the people they affect. They work in Steward Circles with mandate: oversight of AI use, guardrails, receipts and explanation, community liaison, and ethical escalation.

Practice highlights

Receipts-by-default for high-stakes systems: decision logs, model cards, appeals.

Truth Mesh: synthesize journalism, science, civic testimony, lived experience; surface disagreements; document the decision path.

Reversible moves: define pilot boundaries, harm indicators, and pre-commit rollback conditions.

Monthly Circle Ritual (template)

Check-in: worries and bright spots

New AI initiatives: purpose, affected groups, data, harms

Incident/harm review: complaints, near misses, receipts present?

Policy updates: clarify and revise

Care and rotation: avoid burnout; rotate duties
