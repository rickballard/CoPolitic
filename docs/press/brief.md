Press / Briefing — AIFD + Academia Shock

Summary (<=100 words).
Organizations are racing to embed AI into operations and policy. The AI Front Door (AIFD) is a simple public entry to show where AI is used, why, and how it’s governed. The companion preprint Academia Shock (v1.1.1) documents reproducible, artifact-first workflows so claims about governance can be independently verified. This reduces legal and reputational risk while improving trust and outcomes. (DOI pending Zenodo minting.)
