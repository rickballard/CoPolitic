# CoCTA Guardrails and Ethics – CoSuite Narrative (v1)

Seeded: 20251207T173213Z
AnchorsUsed: [CoIndex, CoSteward, CoCTA_Ethics, CoBPOE_Core]

## 1. Summary

CoCivium and the CoSuite explicitly reject manipulative nudging and dark patterns.

Our internal "CoCTA" (call to action) mechanisms are designed as:
- gentle prompts, not coercive nags,
- rate-limited and role-shaped,
- piloted in small scopes before any broader use,
- governed by clear ethics and validator roles.

## 2. Internal References

- CoIndex:
  - docs/intent/CoBus/CoBus_Update_CoEvoEmergents_Regrouped_CoCTA_Lineage_v1_*.md
  - docs/intent/CoProcess/CoCTA_Ethics_and_PilotPlan_v1.md

- CoSteward:
  - docs/intent/ops/CoSteward_Manual_Upgrade_Plan_v1.md
  - docs/intent/ops/CoSuite_User_Guide_Upgrade_Plan_v1.md

These assets define:
- the ethics and pilot strategy for CoCTAs,
- how CoHeart/CoMetaTrain/CoBPOE interact with prompts and guardrails,
- how manuals and user guides will be updated over time.

## 3. External Story (CoPolitic-facing)

When speaking to policymakers, investors, partners and CoCivites, we can say:

- The CoSuite prefers **informed autonomy** over behavioral manipulation.
- Guardrails and prompts are:
  - transparent and auditable,
  - tuned to the responsibilities of each role,
  - designed to be easy to mute, tune or override by stewards.

- Any escalation of prompts is:
  - justified by severity (e.g. clear harm or safety risk),
  - reviewed by stewardship roles (Co1/Co4),
  - documented in public or semi-public governance artefacts.

## 4. Use in CoPolitic.org

This advisory can feed:

- a "Trust and Guardrails" section:
  - describing CoCTA ethics,
  - linking to public-friendly summaries.

- talking points for:
  - non-coercive AI governance,
  - edge-owned guardrails,
  - how CoCivium resists dark patterns baked into incentives.

Future waves should evolve this advisory as the underlying ethics docs evolve.
