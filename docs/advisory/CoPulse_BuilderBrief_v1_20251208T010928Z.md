# CoPulse Builder Brief (v1)
Seeded: 20251208T010928Z
Session: CoEvoEmergents

## Purpose
Give the Sites / CoScendence.org lane a minimal starting point for CoPulse:
a gentle, sonic-visual expression of CoSuite system health (not alerts).

## Inputs
- Tier A/B/C events (counts, successes, friction).
- CoHeart notes (optional).
- CoMetaTrain lineage checks (aggregated).
- CoCTA pilot metrics (frequency, overrides).

## Output Concept
A soft 'whalesong-like' heartbeat:
- non-intrusive,
- ambient,
- beautiful rather than urgent,
- suitable for optional dashboards or site embeds.

## Constraints
- Never used for coercive UX.
- Never used to signal emergencies (those remain human-readable).
- Must be easy to mute or ignore.

Future waves may add symbolic CoGibber layer mappings.
