# CoPolitic.org Site Plan v2

Session: CoPolitic20251201 (MegaWave v2)
Source theory: CoTheory of Civilization (CoCivium), Academia Shock handoff.

## 1. Purpose

CoPolitic.org is the civic face of CoCivium.

- Explain the two futures of AI civilization:
  - Core controlled stability (authoritarian convergence).
  - Edge balanced stability (pluralistic coevolution).
- Give people a plain-language Perspective Plan they can use without decoding jargon.
- Invite stewards, elites, youth, and researchers into simple Labs that test edge balanced patterns.
- Point people to concrete artifacts:
  - Academia Shock preprint and summary.
  - CoTheory of Civilization article suite.
  - CoGuard and CoIndex guardrail work.

Tone: plain language, human interest, and lightly strange. It should feel like a signal from a near future,
not a normal think tank site.

## 2. Primary audiences

1. Civic stewards
   - Regulators, public servants, city builders, union organisers, NGO leads.
   - Want guardrails that work, tools that are auditable, and language they can defend in public.

2. Elites with a conscience
   - Executives, investors, institutional leaders.
   - Want an off ramp from late stage platform capitalism that does not just rebrand extraction.

3. Youth and emerging leaders
   - People growing up with a million virtual staffers and no clear map.
   - Want a purpose bigger than attention and coins.

4. Researchers and journalists
   - People who need names for patterns they already see.
   - Want concepts and citations that survive scrutiny.

## 3. Information architecture (v2)

- Home (`index.html`)
  - Hero: “Edge balanced futures for AI and democracy.”
  - Short explainer of the two attractors.
  - “Who CoPolitic is for” audience pills.
  - Calls to action:
    - See the two futures (Why now).
    - For stewards / elites / youth.
    - Labs.

- Why now (`why-now.html`)
  - Problem framing.
  - Two stability attractors.
  - Plain-language Perspective Plan section:
    - Commons power.
    - Stewardship.
    - Truth alignment.
  - “What this means for you” section aligned with the Perspective Plan.

- For stewards (`for-stewards.html`)
  - Definition of Steward vs classic executive.
  - Edge owned evidence, CoCache / CoGuard / CoIndex.
  - “First steps you can take” with 2–3 concrete moves.
  - Pointer into Labs.

- For elites (`for-elites.html`)
  - “You are already in the end game” framing.
  - Risks of authoritarian convergence for incumbents.
  - What partnering with CoPolitic can look like.
  - Pointer to InSeed for deeper commercial work.

- For youth (`for-youth.html`)
  - Growing up with a million virtual staffers.
  - CoScendence framing.
  - “Ways to practice CoScendence” section.
  - Pointer into Labs.

- Labs (`labs.html`)
  - Explains Labs as small, replicable experiments.
  - Three starter Labs:
    - Perspective Plan workshop.
    - Edge owned evidence sprint.
    - Youth co-governance sandbox.

Later waves can add:

- Publications / Library.
- Deeper CoGuard and CoIndex explainers.
- Multi language variants.
- Case study detail pages for Labs.

## 4. Narrative anchors

- “Edge balanced stability” vs “core controlled stability”.
- “No coercion, no corruption, no crowns.”
- “Tools and tool makers growing up together.”
- “I think, therefore I am, therefore I am to think.”

CoPolitic repeatedly points back to CoCivium and CoTheory as the deeper substrate, and forward to InSeed when
organisations need commercial strategy help.

## 5. Technical notes

- v1/v2 live in `docs/site-v1/` as static HTML for portability.
- This plan and copy blocks live under `docs/intent/site/`.
- Co1 and future sessions can:
  - Wrap this in a static site generator.
  - Deploy via GitHub Pages or other hosting.
  - Localise copy.
