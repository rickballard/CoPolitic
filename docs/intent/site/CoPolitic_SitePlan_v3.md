# CoPolitic Site Plan v3

Version: 3
Session: CoPolitic20251201

## Purpose

CoPolitic.org is the CoCivium-facing hub for people who shape rules, capital, and culture around AI civilization.  
Site v3 focuses on:

- Making the "Perspective Plan" (perspective plane) feel safe and purposeful.
- Making "Labs" concrete: real experiments, repeatable patterns, and on-ramps.
- Giving visitors a clear path to contact and collaboration without over-claiming.

## Core pages

1. `index.html` – Home
   - Short framing of the two attractors (core-controlled vs edge-balanced).
   - CTAs into: Why now, For stewards, For elites, For youth, Labs.

2. `why-now.html` – Context and urgency
   - Two attractors explained in plain language.
   - Perspective map framed explicitly as:
     - A way to notice patterns, not a diagnostic.
     - A way to compare stories from different tribes without forcing agreement.
   - Copy ensures:
     - No one has to accept CoCivium to learn from the framing.
     - The map is about institutional patterns, not about labeling individuals.

3. `for-stewards.html`
   - Audience: regulators, public servants, union leaders, city builders, institutional stewards.
   - Emphasis:
     - Edge-owned evidence (CoCache, CoGuard, CoIndex).
     - Guardrails that can be shown to the public.
     - Stories and language to explain why some futures are worth protecting.
   - CTA: explore Labs and CoCivium; reach out for pilots.

4. `for-elites.html`
   - Audience: platform founders, investors, senior policymakers, large-fund stewards.
   - Emphasis:
     - Late-stage platform logic vs steward logic.
     - "Authoritarian convergence" as a systemic attractor, not a moral accusation.
     - Off-ramps that preserve dignity, capital, and legacy.
   - CTA: Labs as a safe place to prototype stewarded strategies.

5. `for-youth.html`
   - Audience: students, early career builders, young organizers.
   - Emphasis:
     - CoScendence: growing up with AIs instead of being invisibly shaped by them.
     - Practicing agency, empathy, and evidence-based thinking.
     - Joining steward-minded communities rather than lone-wolf acceleration.
   - CTA: Labs experiments, reading paths, and stewardship challenges.

6. `labs.html`
   - The main evolution in v3.
   - Structured as:
     - Intro: what we mean by "labs" (lightweight experiments with people + AI tools).
     - A small catalog of named labs:
       - Perspective Plane Lab
       - Guardrail Jam
       - Civic Twin Sprint
     - Each lab describes:
       - Inputs (who, what data, which tools).
       - Moves (what we do together).
       - Outputs (maps, decisions, stories, guardrails).
     - A soft contact / collaboration section:
       - Clear statement: early-stage experiments, not formal endorsements.
       - Contact channel via InSeed (for now).
       - Suggestion that institutions can fork these labs locally.

## Labs catalog v2

See `CoPolitic_LabsCatalog_v2.md` for details that are kept in sync with `labs.html`.  
The intent docs are written for Co1 / CoCivium stewards; the HTML is written for external visitors.

## Contact and attribution

Public contact (v3):

- Email: contact@InSeed.com
- Mail: Ballard, 1673 Lakeshore Rd W, Mississauga, ON L5J 1J4
- Phone: +1.416.414.8100 (mobile)

The site makes clear that:

- CoPolitic.org is part of the broader CoCivium experiment.
- InSeed currently acts as a steward / incubator for this work.
- Nothing on the site is investment advice, legal advice, or a promise of future performance.

## Perspective Plan expectations

When someone encounters the perspective map/plane through CoPolitic:

- **Expectation setting (before):**
  - "This is not a personality test. It is a way to talk about patterns in systems."
  - "You can disagree with the labels and still find it useful to see how different stories land on the same plane."
  - "CoCivium has opinions about healthier attractors, but you are not asked to sign a loyalty oath to use this map."

- **Outcome framing (after):**
  - People should feel:
    - Less confused about why different factions feel stuck.
    - More able to translate between tribal narratives.
    - Less tempted to treat stability narratives as destiny.

We keep the heavy theory in CoCivium / CoTheory assets.  
CoPolitic uses only what is needed to serve stewards, elites, and youth without overwhelming them.

## Future hooks (beyond v3)

Not implemented yet, but anticipated:

- A simple signup form (hosted via external service) for lab pilots.
- Links to public writeups of completed experiments.
- A dedicated "Questions" page for common pushback and edge cases.
