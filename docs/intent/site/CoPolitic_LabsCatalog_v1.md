# CoPolitic Labs Catalog v1

This catalog mirrors the `labs.html` page and adds a little more structure for future sessions and Co1.

## Lab 1: Perspective Plan workshop

- Goal: help a mixed group see one decision or institution through the lenses of commons power, stewardship,
  and truth alignment.
- Inputs:
  - One concrete decision, policy, or product.
  - A simple diagram of the Perspective Plan axes.
- Steps (sketch):
  1. Describe the decision in plain language.
  2. Place the current state on each axis as a group.
  3. Design one step that would increase commons power, stewardship, or truth alignment.
  4. Capture the result in a one-page public note.
- Outputs:
  - A one-page map.
  - A short public note of what will be tried next.

## Lab 2: Edge owned evidence sprint

- Goal: run one recurring decision on edge owned evidence with receipts and guardrails.
- Inputs:
  - One decision that repeats (funding, hiring, policy, product).
  - A simple way to publish evidence and tradeoffs (e.g. a public log or shared document).
- Steps (sketch):
  1. Name the decision and who it affects.
  2. List evidence sources and who controls them.
  3. Agree what will be made legible to the people affected.
  4. Run the decision once using this pattern.
  5. Review with participants.
- Outputs:
  - A visible record of evidence, tradeoffs, and participants.
  - Lessons for CoGuard / CoIndex patterns.

## Lab 3: Youth co-governance sandbox

- Goal: let youth design and run a small commons with AI tools as staff, not rulers.
- Inputs:
  - A modest pool of resources (fund, space, time).
  - Access to AI tools with simple guardrails.
- Steps (sketch):
  1. Youth define the purpose and rules of the sandbox.
  2. Adults provide safety bounds and legal cover.
  3. Run a cycle of decisions with receipts and open reflection.
- Outputs:
  - A case study that can be compared across cities or schools.
  - Youth who have practiced stewarding tools, not just using them.
