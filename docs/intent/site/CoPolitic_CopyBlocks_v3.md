This file keeps copy snippets in one place so the static site and future CMS-backed versions stay in sync.

## Tagline options

- "Helping stewards and elites choose edge-balanced AI civilization."
- "Tools and language for an AI century that stays humanly inhabitable."

## Labs intro (short)

> CoPolitic Labs are small, honest experiments where humans and AIs think together about rules, guardrails, and futures.  
> We run them with stewards, elites, and youth who are ready to test better ways of sharing power with AI.

## Labs intro (long)

> When we say "labs" we do not mean billion-dollar buildings full of white coats.  
> We mean focused, time-bound experiments where:
> - a few people who can move real systems,
> - sit with people who are affected by those systems,
> - and use AI tools as thinking partners instead of oracles.
>
> Each lab is designed to be forkable: you should be able to take the pattern home and rerun it in your own city, institution, or community.

## Contact / collaboration block (for Labs page)

> CoPolitic Labs are early-stage experiments.  
> They do **not** represent endorsements from any government, university, or funder.
>
> If you are a steward, leader, or youth organizer who wants to run a lab or adapt one:
>
> - Email: contact@InSeed.com  
> - Mail: Ballard, 1673 Lakeshore Rd W, Mississauga, ON L5J 1J4  
> - Phone: +1.416.414.8100 (mobile)
>
> For now, InSeed helps host and coordinate these experiments. Over time, we expect many of them to be run by local stewards, unions, and civic groups with CoCivium tools in the background.

## Perspective Plane expectation block (for Why now)

> The perspective map you may have seen in CoCivium papers is a way to talk about **systems**, not a way to label people.  
> You are not asked to agree with every axis or label.  
> If all it does is give you one new way to compare stories from different tribes, it has done its job.
