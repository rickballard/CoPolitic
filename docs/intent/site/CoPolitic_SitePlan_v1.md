# CoPolitic.org Site Plan v1

Session: CoPolitic20251201  
Source theory: CoTheory of Civilization (CoCivium), Academia Shock preprint.

## 1. Purpose

CoPolitic.org is the civic face of CoCivium.

- Explain the two futures of AI civilization:
  - Core controlled stability (authoritarian convergence).
  - Edge balanced stability (pluralistic coevolution).
- Invite stewards, policymakers, activists, and concerned citizens into edge balanced futures.
- Point people to concrete artifacts:
  - Academia Shock preprint.
  - CoTheory of Civilization article suite.
  - CoGuard and CoIndex guardrail work.

The tone is plain language, human interest, and lightly strange. It should feel like a signal from a near future, not a normal think tank site.

## 2. Primary audiences

1. Civic stewards  
   - Regulators, public servants, city builders, NGO leads.  
   - What they want: guardrails that work, tools that are auditable, language they can defend in public.

2. Elites with a conscience  
   - Executives, investors, institutional leaders.  
   - What they want: not to be trapped in platform wars or late stage extraction games.

3. Youth and emerging leaders  
   - People growing up with a million virtual staffers and no clear map.  
   - What they want: a purpose bigger than attention and coins.

4. Researchers and journalists  
   - People who need names for patterns they already see.  
   - What they want: concepts and citations that survive scrutiny.

## 3. Information architecture (v1)

- Home (`index.html`)
  - Hero: "Edge balanced futures for AI and democracy."
  - Short explainer of the two attractors.
  - Three calls to action:
    - "For stewards"
    - "For elites"
    - "For youth"
  - Links:
    - Academia Shock preprint.
    - CoTheory of Civilization.

- Why now (`why-now.html`)
  - Problem framing:
    - Acceleration is real and asymmetric.
    - Human talent trapped inside winner platforms.
    - Communal Mindshare Environments are coming.
  - Two stability attractors section (core controlled vs edge balanced).
  - Short timeline vignette.

- For stewards (`for-stewards.html`)
  - Definition of a Steward vs a classic executive.
  - How edge owned evidence and guardrails work (CoCache, CoGuard, CoIndex).
  - Concrete asks:
    - Start a steward circle.
    - Run small pilots with CoCivium tools.
    - Connect with CoCivium for briefings.

- For elites (`for-elites.html`)
  - "You are already in the end game" message.
  - Risks of authoritarian convergence for incumbents.
  - Stewardship as an off ramp:
    - Same skills, different scoreboard.
  - Invitation to engage via InSeed and CoPolitic together.

- For youth (`for-youth.html`)
  - Opening story: child with a million virtual staffers.
  - Risks of capture by platforms and optimized feeds.
  - CoScendence as a training path.
  - Pointers to learning resources and communities.

Later waves can add:

- Publications / Library.
- CoGuard and CoIndex explainers.
- Multi language variants.

## 4. Narrative anchors

- "Edge balanced stability" vs "core controlled stability".
- "No coercion, no corruption, no crowns."
- "Tools and tool makers growing up together."
- "I think, therefore I am, therefore I am to think."

CoPolitic should repeatedly point back to CoCivium and CoTheory as the deeper substrate, and forward to InSeed when organizations need commercial strategy help.

## 5. Technical notes

- v1 lives in `docs/site-v1/` as static HTML for portability.
- Co1 and future sessions can:
  - Wrap this in a static site generator.
  - Deploy via GitHub Pages or other hosting.
  - Localize copy.
