# Handoff → CoPolitic20251201 — 20251202T104227Z

**Scope received:** CoCloud/CoTrailer pattern, guard, docs, and trailer stubs.  
**Ask:** Ingest this pack, surface on CoPolitic.org, then forward remaining options to **Co1**.

## What to do here (CoPolitic20251201)
- Publish docs/insights/CoTheoryOfCivilization/* on site navigation.
- Ensure .github/workflows/cotrailer-guard.yml runs on PRs.
- Add .cotrail.* to critical site pages and diagrams.
- Embed CoCloud_Map.md (artifact) or render its Mermaid in a page.

## Outstanding options (please carry to Co1 after site work)
- Add CoNoiseBudget config + validator enforcement.
- Auto-banner Academia Shock DOI when minted (patch drive).
- Extend trailers with eceipts.min_level and ollback.conditions.
- Seed 2 caselets from Human-Interest v4 into site.

**Next hop:** After completing the above, open a CoBus note to **Co1** with links to the merged PRs and the CoCloud map.
