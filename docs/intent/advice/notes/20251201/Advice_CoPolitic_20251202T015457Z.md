# CoPolitic — Advice note (AIFD migration + Academia Shock tie-in)

## Purpose
Make the public-facing **CoPolitic** surface align with 'AI Front Door' (AIFD) naming and point clearly to the **Academia Shock v1.1.1** preprint for credibility and citation.

## What to do
1) Remove all 'TOS-AI' wording and ids. Prefer 'AIFD' and 'AI Front Door'.
2) Add a small banner or CTA that links to the Academia Shock release and (once minted) DOI.
3) Expose a simple /front-door human overview that mirrors the repo’s docs/front-door content.
4) Add a press/briefing section: summary paragraph, 3 bullets, 1 pull-quote, and links.

## Copy blocks (starter)
**Banner:**  
'Read the Academia Shock preprint (v1.1.1) — reproducible AI governance workflows.'  
Link target: CoCivium release tag cademia-shock-preprint-v1.1.1 (and later the DOI page).

**Pull-quote:**  
'Governance claims are credible only when they are reproducible by strangers.'

## Checklist
- [ ] Replace page ids 	osai-* with fd-*
- [ ] Update any CTA text: 'Request an AI Front Door'
- [ ] Link: CoCivium → releases → academia-shock-preprint-v1.1.1
- [ ] After DOI is minted, add 'Cite: DOI …' near the banner
- [ ] Ensure sitemap includes /front-door

## Receipts to date
- CoCivium: v1.1.1 release with PDFs attached
- AIFD docs seeded in CoCivium+InSeed; 'CoPortal' deprecated
- PR queues collapsed to keep main clean

## Next steps
- Mint DOI via Zenodo (one-time enable, then re-save release)
- Patch DOI in CITATION.cff and landing
- Publish a short 'why it matters' post from CoPolitic linking to the preprint
