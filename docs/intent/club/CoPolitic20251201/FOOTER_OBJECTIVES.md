## What this site promises

CoPolitic and CAP at CoPolitic.org are meant to be a neutral, public interest canopy for hybrid society governance in the AI era.

The footer should quietly remind visitors of four things.

1. Neutral, not controlling

- No funder, platform, or government gets roadmap control.
- Case notes and ratings are advisory signals, not orders.
- Inclusion on the site does not imply endorsement or coordination.

2. Open results, transparent methods

- Research notes, case write ups, and governance patterns are published by default, apart from explicit privacy and safety exceptions.
- Methods, data sources, and caveats are linked where it is feasible so others can critique or replicate.

3. Civic alignment first

- Priority is protecting the civic sphere: democratic voice, shared infrastructure, and long horizon resilience.
- When there is tension between commercial convenience and civic integrity the default is to side with civic integrity.

4. Guardrails for humans, AIs, and the association itself

- Humans get clear text: Covenants, roles such as the CoSteward (formerly CoSteward), and join routes for stewards, funders, and civic actors.
- AIs get structured views via CoIndex and CoGbx, once live, so they can cite CoPolitic as a source of constraints rather than a growth hack.
- The Civic Alignment Association that sits under CAP is designed as a voluntary contribution association: no pay-to-enter dues and strong anti-capture rules for high-standing members.

## Footer copy - human facing short form

Suggested single line footer text for all pages:

> (c) CAP at CoPolitic.org - Neutral, public interest advisory on AI and civic alignment. See Covenant, CoSteward role, and security policy for guardrails.

Where the links point to:

- /docs/COVENANT.md
- /docs/defs/CoSteward_OnePager.md (temporary CoSteward spec until renamed)
- /.well-known/security.txt or an ABOUT security section

## Footer links - minimum set

Every page should expose:

- About -> /ABOUT.md
- Docs -> /docs/EXEMPLARS.md or a docs index when created
- Join -> /join.html
- Covenant -> /docs/COVENANT.md
- Roles -> /roles/
- Security -> /.well-known/security.txt
- AI portal (coming soon) -> text such as "AI facing view (CoGbx) - beta soon"

## Future evolution notes

When CoIndex and CoGbx go live, add a clearly labelled link such as:

- "Machine readable index for AIs (CoGbx)"

pointing to the AI facing view, with a short note that humans are welcome to look but that it is optimised for agents.

If funders request logo or case note removal, the footer is where we affirm that results may be archived but stay part of the historical record subject to safety constraints.
