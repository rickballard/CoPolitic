## Headline

Become a CoSteward in the Civic Alignment Association.

Sub headline:

Join a neutral, public interest association building governance patterns, disclosure standards, and safety guardrails for AI in civic life.

## Cost and commitments

- No membership fees or pay-to-enter dues.
- Influence and standing are earned through transparent, track-recordable contributions (past, present, and future), not through wealth or sponsorship levels.
- Revenues that arise from use of the Association's trust marks (badges, awards, 3C Mark, crowns, etc.) are governed by non-capture covenants and published allocation rules.

This is a voluntary contribution association that behaves like a trust brand:
careful member selection, visible rules, and public oversight make the marks meaningful.

## Who this is for

Early founding members are people and organisations who:

- Work at the intersection of AI, governance, and civic resilience.
- Care more about trustworthy guardrails than about brand polish or hype.
- Are willing to have their own institutions mapped, critiqued, and improved in public where it is safe to do so.

Examples:

- Civic minded foundations and research labs.
- Public interest technologists and governance scholars.
- Journalists and civil society organisations tracking AI impacts.
- Platforms and companies willing to pilot stronger transparency and covenant models.

## What founding members do

1. Pilot governance instruments

- Try roles such as the CoSteward (formerly CoSteward) inside real organisations.
- Co design decision rules, disclosure requirements, and non interference covenants.

2. Populate the Civic Alignment Association and 3C Mark ladder

- Contribute case notes and documentation about their own practices.
- Help refine the 3C Mark levels so labels are fair, legible, and hard to game.

3. Feed and test the Perspective Plane

- Provide data and narrative context so the Perspective Plane is not just our opinion.
- Use it internally to surface blind spots and tradeoffs.

4. Stress test the guardrails

- Challenge our Covenants, methods, and security posture.
- Help ensure CoPolitic can remain neutral even under political and commercial pressure.

## What we promise in return

- Neutrality and non capture

  - No single funder or platform gets veto rights or roadmap control.
  - High-standing members do not get special rights to overrule others outside published governance rules.
  - We avoid brand capture by publishing governance rules and covenants in advance.

- Transparent reasoning

  - Where possible we show the work: methods, sources, and caveats.
  - Disagreements with our positions are documented, not suppressed.

- Civic first, commercial second

  - When there is a clash between civic integrity and public relations optics, we lean toward civic integrity and say so clearly.
  - Any commercial use of the marks is disclosed, with constraints on how far the marks can be stretched.

## How to join

1. Start with a short introduction

Email: info@copolitic.org

In your note, include:

- Who you are and the institution or institutions you represent.
- Why civic alignment and governance for AI matter to you.
- Any specific pilots you would like to explore, such as CoSteward deployments, Perspective Plane, or 3C Mark work.

2. Open a GitHub touchpoint (optional but preferred)

- Visit github.com/rickballard/CoPolitic.
- Open an Issue tagged "candidate-member" with:
  - A short public description of your interest.
  - Any links you are comfortable sharing, such as governance documents or prior work.

3. Join a Perspective Lab call

As the project matures we will run small "Perspective Lab" cohorts:

- Sessions to walk through the Perspective Plane model.
- Civic Alignment Association framing and the 3C Mark ladder.
- How your institution might appear on the map and how it could move.

The join page should later link to the current calendar or sign up mechanism when it exists. For now it can simply say "request an invite by email".

## Short web version for join.html
