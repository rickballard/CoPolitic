# CoPolitic – CoCivium 3C Mark Levels (v1)

Session: CoPolitic20251201

---

## 1. What the 3C Mark is

The **CoCivium 3C Mark** is a **non-commercial, contestable badge** for organisations
and initiatives that commit to better behaviour in a hybrid (human plus AI) society.

- The mark is symbolised by **three nested Cs** forming a human-shaped negative space.
- It is **never sold**. It can only be:
  - Self-claimed at lower levels (with evidence).
  - Recognised at higher levels by CAP processes.
- Every mark links back to a **public evidence page** on CoPolitic.org.

Intent:

> To give organisations a way to say  
> "We are trying to do this properly, in public, and you can check our homework"  
> and to give the world a way to **push back** when that is not true.

---

## 2. Levels overview

Proposed ladder:

1. **Observed**  
2. **Pledged**  
3. **Practicing**  
4. **Verified (vYYYY)**

Each level is **in a public registry** with:

- Evidence links.
- Date of last review.
- Open challenges, if any.

---

## 3. Level 0 – Observed

**Observed** is not a badge the organisation flies; it is an internal state in CAP and the index.

Criteria (informal):

- CAP is tracking the organisation because:
  - It has significant influence on AI systems or policy, or
  - It affects large populations in hybrid-society contexts.
- There is enough public information to write a **neutral case note**.

What appears publicly:

- A CoPolitic.org page with:
  - Logo and name.
  - Neutral description.
  - Evidence stack (reports, statements, incidents).
- No 3C Mark usage allowed.

---

## 4. Level 1 – Pledged

**Pledged** is the first **publicly flyable** level.

Requirements (draft):

1. The organisation publishes a **public pledge** that:
   - References the CoCivium covenant or equivalent federation of principles.
   - Commits to a **minimum set of behaviours** (transparency, human rights, civic harm reduction, and similar).
   - Links to the CoPolitic.org **3C Mark explainer**.

2. The organisation:
   - Lists **a contact point** for governance or alignment concerns.
   - Invites external critique or whistleblowing via some channel.

Evidence:

- URLs to pledge page or pages.
- Internal policy documents where possible.
- Date when pledge was adopted.

Badge usage:

- Label: CoCivium 3C Mark – Pledged.
- Must link to the organisation's CoPolitic.org registry page.
- Must display a note:  
  > "Pledge is self-claimed; see public evidence and challenges."

---

## 5. Level 2 – Practicing

**Practicing** indicates material follow-through on the pledge.

Requirements (draft):

1. All **Pledged** requirements.

2. Concrete practices, such as:

   - Regular **impact or risk reporting** on AI systems.
   - Documented **governance structures** (boards, committees, auditors).
   - Processes for **redressing harm** or reversing problematic deployments.
   - Evidence of **staff empowerment** to raise concerns.

3. At least one **public artefact** per year that reflects learning or change:

   - Updated policies or standards.
   - Post-mortems or retro reports.
   - New safeguards or civic partnerships.

Recognition process:

- A small **CAP steward panel** examines evidence (documented in repo).
- Panel publishes a short **rationale note** with dissent if any.

Badge usage:

- Label: CoCivium 3C Mark – Practicing.
- Must link back to the registry page and rationale.
- Recommended note:  
  > "Practices recognised by CAP stewards; status is contestable."

---

## 6. Level 3 – Verified (vYYYY)

**Verified (vYYYY)** is the highest current level.

Requirements (draft):

1. All **Practicing** requirements.

2. Evidence of **independent review or audit**, such as:

   - External audits of governance or alignment practices.
   - Peer-reviewed frameworks.
   - Certification under open, civic-minded standards.

3. A clear **scope statement**:

   - What systems or activities are in scope of verification.
   - Which are explicitly out-of-scope (no halo allowed).

4. Time-bounded validity:

   - Verified (vYYYY) expires if not re-examined within a set interval.

Recognition process:

- CAP stewards publish a **verification memo** per organisation:
  - What was checked.
  - Which sources.
  - Known gaps and limitations.

Badge usage:

- Label: CoCivium 3C Mark – Verified (vYYYY).
- Mandatory link to:
  - Verification memo.
  - Evidence stack.
  - Open challenge thread, if any.

---

## 7. Challenges, suspensions, revocations

The "middle finger" to captured certification outfits comes from **formalised contestability**.

Any of the following can be triggered by **public issues** in the repo:

- **Challenge:**  
  Anyone raises a question about:
  - Evidence quality.
  - Material omissions.
  - Conflicts of interest.

- **Suspension:**  
  Temporary status change when:
  - A credible incident is under investigation.
  - Evidence is clearly stale.

- **Revocation:**  
  Removal of a 3C level when:
  - Evidence shows serious, unresolved breaches of the covenant.
  - The organisation refuses to remedy or disclose material issues.

Every challenge or status change:

- Is logged with dates, rationale, and participants.
- Keeps the **history visible**; we do not erase the story.

---

## 8. Alignment with CoIndex / GIBindex (placeholder)

As CoIndex comes online:

- "3CMark-LevelObserved", "3CMark-LevelPledged", and similar should become terms in GIBindex.
- This file should align with those definitions and reference IDs where appropriate.
- Any future change to level definitions should:

  - Update this file.
  - Update the corresponding CoIndex entries.
  - Be reviewed via CAP governance.
