# CoPolitic – CAP Club Overview (v1)

Session: CoPolitic20251201

## 1. Purpose of CoPolitic / CAP

**CoPolitic.org** operates the **Civic Alignment Protectorate (CAP)**:

- A **neutral, public-interest canopy** for AI-era governance.
- A **public index** of institutions experimenting in good faith with AI governance, risk, and assurance.
- A **non-commercial club** of stewards, funders, and civic brands who help shape and enforce better norms.

CAP exists to:

1. Make it easy to see **who is doing what** in AI governance.
2. Make our own **methods and conflicts** transparent.
3. Provide a **shared instrument panel** (Perspective Lab + evidence stacks) for civic-scale decisions.

---

## 2. The "club" in one page

Think of CAP as:

> A club where **serious institutions, philanthropies, labs, regulators, and watchdogs**  
> co-steward **better rules and badges** for AI-era civic behaviour —  
> in full public view.

### 2.1 Who can be in the CAP circle?

Examples:

- Philanthropic funds and foundations.
- Frontier AI labs and safety orgs.
- Standards bodies and regulators.
- Civic watchdogs, civil society coalitions, media.
- Stewards / service firms (for example InSeed), treated as **members, not owners**.

CAP is explicitly:

- **Non-partisan:** no party or ideology ownership.
- **Non-commercial:** no pay-to-play listings or "reputation boosts".
- **Contestable:** listings, marks, and methods can be challenged in public.

### 2.2 What members actually do

CAP members:

- **Co-fund** and **co-govern** CoCivium / CoPolitic infrastructure.
- **Co-design** and **vote on**:
  - Selection criteria for exemplars.
  - Levels of the **CoCivium 3C Mark** (see separate spec).
  - Use of the **Perspective Lab** as a shared "board".

- **Accept being indexed themselves**:
  - CAP members appear in the same index as other actors.
  - Their CAP status and any 3C Mark level is logged with evidence and dissent.

## 3. Relationship to InSeed and CoSuite

This needs to be crisp and visible on-site.

### 3.1 InSeed

- InSeed may **found, fund, or steward** CoPolitic / CAP work.
- InSeed is **listed as an actor** in the CoPolitic index with:
  - A public case note.
  - Disclosed relationships and roles.
- InSeed **does not own** CAP and **cannot buy** better listing or marks.

### 3.2 CoSuite / CoCivium

- CoSuite / CoCivium provide **open-source tools, schemas, and BPOEs** that CAP can use:
  - CoAudit-like trust engines.
  - CoIndex / GIBindex vocab.
  - CoSteward-style governance docs.
- CAP uses these because they are **useful and open**, not because they are proprietary.
- Over time, CAP-related concepts (for example "3C Mark", "CAP-MemberCircle") should be registered in **CoIndex / GIBindex** and treated as shared vocabulary.

### 3.3 Longevity and independence

- CAP is designed to **outlive any one steward, company, or political climate**.
- All rules, marks, and processes are kept:
  - On public repos.
  - Under open licenses.
  - With change logs and issue histories exposed.

## 4. Public-facing promises (high-level)

These should map to footer objectives and transparency pages.

CAP commits to:

1. **No pay-to-play.**  
   No organisation can buy a listing, a higher tier, or a better case note.

2. **Full relationship disclosure.**  
   Any material funding, employment, advisory, or equity links between CAP stewards and listed entities must be disclosed.

3. **Evidence-first indexing.**  
   Every case note and 3C Mark decision is backed by public evidence, with clear links and timestamps.

4. **Contestability by design.**  
   Anyone can open a public issue to challenge:
   - Our criteria.
   - A specific listing or mark.
   - The behaviour of CAP itself.

5. **Non-partisan behaviour.**  
   CAP may criticise or praise behaviour, but never acts as a campaign arm for any party or candidate.

## 5. Connection to the CoCivium 3C Mark

CAP is the primary **governance home** for the **CoCivium 3C Mark**:

- CAP members help refine the level definitions and requirements.
- CoPolitic.org hosts:
  - The **specification** of the mark.
  - The **registry** of current holders and their evidence.
  - The **log of challenges and revocations**.

Implementation details live in:

- CAP_3C_MARK_LEVELS.md – conceptual levels.
- CAP_3C_BADGE_SPECS.md – visual and usage rules.
- CoIndex / GIBindex – canonical vocabulary entries (once wired).
