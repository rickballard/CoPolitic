    <h1>Become a founding CoSteward</h1>
    <p>
      CoPolitic's Civic Alignment Protectorate (CAP) is building neutral, public interest
      guardrails for AI. Founding CoStewards help prototype covenants, roles, and tools that
      put civic life ahead of growth-at-all-costs incentives.
    </p>

    <h2>What kind of association is this?</h2>
    <p>
      CAP is forming a voluntary Civic Alignment Association. There are no membership fees
      or pay-to-enter dues. Standing and influence are earned through transparent, trackable
      contributions – the work you have done, are doing, or commit to do for civic alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revenues that arise from use of the Association's trust marks (badges, awards, 3C Mark,
      crowns, etc.) are governed by published non-capture covenants so that no single whale,
      government, or platform can buy control.
    </p>

    <h2>Who this is for</h2>
    <p>Early founding members are people and organisations who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work at the intersection of AI, governance, and civic resilience.</li>
      <li>Care more about trustworthy guardrails than brand polish or hype.</li>
      <li>Are willing to have their own institutions mapped, critiqued, and improved in public where it is safe to do so.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Examples include civic minded foundations and research labs, public interest technologists and governance scholars,
      journalists and civil society organisations, and platforms or companies willing to pilot stronger transparency and covenant models.
    </p>

    <h2>What founding CoStewards do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pilot governance instruments such as the CoSteward role (currently specified in the legacy CoSteward one-pager) and non interference covenants.</li>
      <li>Help populate the Civic Alignment Association and 3C Mark ladder with fair, evidence based case notes.</li>
      <li>Feed and critique public tools like the Perspective Plane and CAP case work.</li>
      <li>Stress test CAP's own methods, covenants, and security posture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to start</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Send a short introduction.</strong><br />
        Email: <a href="mailto:info@copolitic.org">info@copolitic.org</a><br />
        Include who you are, which institution(s) you represent, why civic alignment and AI governance matter to you,
        and any specific pilots you would like to explore (CoSteward deployments, Perspective Plane, 3C Mark, etc.).
      </li>
      <li style="margin-top:10px;">
        <strong>Create a GitHub touchpoint (optional but preferred).</strong><br />
        Visit <a href="https://github.com/rickballard/CoPolitic">github.com/rickballard/CoPolitic</a> and open an Issue tagged
        <code>candidate-member</code> with a short public description of your interest and any links you are comfortable sharing.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-top:10px;">
        <strong>Join a Perspective Lab session.</strong><br />
        As CAP matures we will host small "Perspective Lab" calls to walk through the Plane model,
        the Civic Alignment Association framing, and the 3C Mark ladder, and to discuss how your institution might move across the map over time.
        For now, simply request an invite in your email.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Short version:</strong>
      help prototype civic alignment guardrails for AI as a CoSteward in a voluntary Civic Alignment Association.
      Standing comes from contributions, not fees. We expect strong disagreements; those will be documented, not suppressed.
