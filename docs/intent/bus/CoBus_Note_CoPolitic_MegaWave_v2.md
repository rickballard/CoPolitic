# CoBus Note – CoPolitic MegaWave v2

Session: CoPolitic20251201
Wave: MegaWave v2 – CoPolitic.org near-final static site

## Summary

This MegaWave:

- Rebuilds `docs/site-v1/` with a coherent, plain-language static site for CoPolitic.org.
- Tightens alignment with CoTheory of Civilization and the Academia Shock handoff.
- Clarifies the role of the Perspective Plan and makes it easy to understand without diagrams.
- Introduces a Labs page and Labs catalog as the bridge between theory and practice.

## Key artifacts

From this wave:

- `docs/site-v1/index.html` – home, audiences, basic attractor framing.
- `docs/site-v1/why-now.html` – problem framing + Perspective Plan explainer.
- `docs/site-v1/for-stewards.html` – steward framing + first steps + Labs pointer.
- `docs/site-v1/for-elites.html` – end-game framing + partnership sketch.
- `docs/site-v1/for-youth.html` – CoScendence framing + practice ideas.
- `docs/site-v1/labs.html` – three starter Labs.
- `docs/intent/site/CoPolitic_SitePlan_v2.md` – updated site plan.
- `docs/intent/site/CoPolitic_CopyBlocks_v2.md` – copy blocks for reuse.
- `docs/intent/site/CoPolitic_LabsCatalog_v1.md` – structured view of Labs.

Logo assets are still expected to live in `docs/site-v1/assets/` on the CoPolitic repo.
This MegaWave ships placeholders only; Co1 or local sessions should ensure the real logo
files are present.

## Notes for Co1 / CoPrime

- Treat v2 as the near-final textual skeleton for CoPolitic.org.
- Next steps are visual polish, deployment (e.g. GitHub Pages), and translation into
  other languages and media formats.
- The Labs catalog is intended to link to real case studies over time – CoGuard / CoIndex
  workstreams should watch for lab runs that generate evidence.
