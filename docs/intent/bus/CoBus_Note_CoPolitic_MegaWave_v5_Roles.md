# CoBus Note – CoPolitic_MegaWave_v5_Roles

Session: CoPolitic20251201

Scope:
- Add docs/site-v1/roles.html as the new canonical roles landing page for CoPolitic.
- Aligns "stewards", "elites", and "youth" copy with existing pages plus the new Labs and perspective plane flows.
- Clarifies how CoIndex / CoGbx sit behind the site without forcing visitors to learn the indexing language.

Notes:
- This MegaWave is intentionally small and focused: it only adds the roles page and a CoBus note.
- Hosting can route /roles or /roles/ to docs/site-v1/roles.html to replace the deprecated TOS-AI stub mentioned in CoPolitic20251201.
- Future MegaWaves can extend this into playbooks and role-specific lab variants if needed.
