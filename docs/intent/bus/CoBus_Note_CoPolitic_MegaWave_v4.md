# CoBus Note – CoPolitic_MegaWave_v4 (CoIndex aware)

- Session: CoPolitic20251201
- Repo: CoPolitic
- Focus: wire CoPolitic.org site and intent docs to canonical CoIndex / CoGbx views.

Changes in this MegaWave:

- Updates docs/site-v1/why-now.html with a clearer "How to use the perspective plane" section and an AI-facing CoGbx pointers block.
- Rewrites docs/site-v1/labs.html with three named labs plus guidance on running them with AI tools, using CoIndex CoGbx seed views as the shared index.
- Adds docs/intent/site/CoPolitic_CoIndexPointers_v1.md so Co1 and other sessions have a stable pointer doc inside CoPolitic.

Canonical CoIndex / CoGbx links used here:

- Seed view (general orientation):
