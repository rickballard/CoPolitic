# CoBus Note – CoPolitic_MegaWave_v6 roles polish

Session: CoPolitic20251201

This MegaWave refines the CoPolitic roles landing page and keeps it aligned with
the current static site and Labs flows.

## Changes

- Adds `docs/site-v1/roles.html` as a clearer, near-final roles landing page:
  - Explains the three primary roles (Stewards, Elites, Youth) in one screen.
  - Points each role to its "main hallway" page (`for-stewards`, `for-elites`, `for-youth`).
  - Connects each role explicitly to the Labs flows (Perspective Plane Lab, Guardrail Jam,
    Civic Twin Sprint) without re-explaining the labs in full.
  - Adds a short banner on how to safely use AI and CoIndex with CoPolitic.

- Keeps styling consistent with the current v1 static pages (dark background,
  top navigation, chip-style sections).

## Intent

- Give hosting a single canonical target for `/roles` or `/roles/` that matches the
  rest of the CoPolitic site and replaces the deprecated TOS-AI stub.
- Make it obvious, in a few seconds, how each audience should move through
  the site and into Labs.
