# CoBus Note – CoPolitic MegaWave v1

Session: CoPolitic20251201  
Pack time (UTC): 2025-12-02T15:23:27Z

## Scope

This MegaWave focuses on CoPolitic.org narrative and scaffolding:

- Tightens the role and explanation of the Perspective Plane (balance + second language for disagreement).
- Introduces CoPolitic Labs as the visible “experiments” arm of CoPolitic / CoCivium.
- Produces reusable snippets for CoPolitic site v1.1 and future generators.

## Artifacts in this pack

## Suggested next actions (Co1 / CoPrime)

- Confirm that CoPolitic v1.1 IA (Home, Why now, audience pages, Labs) aligns with CoTheory of Civilization suite.
- Decide whether the Perspective Plane will have an explicit interactive treatment in this session, or be deferred.
- If accepted, create follow-up tasks in:
  - CoPolitic repo: wire snippets into site-v1 templates, add nav link to Labs.
  - CoCivium / CoIndex: register Perspective Plane and Labs concepts in GIBindex / CoIndex.
