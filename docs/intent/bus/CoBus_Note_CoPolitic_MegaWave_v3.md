# CoBus Note – CoPolitic_MegaWave_v3

Session: CoPolitic20251201  
Wave: CoPolitic_MegaWave_v3  
Date (UTC): TBD at apply time

## Summary

This MegaWave refines the "Labs" surface and intent for CoPolitic.org and nudges the site toward a near-final v1.

It does not introduce new theory. It:

- Makes the Labs page concrete and inviting.
- Describes three specific, forkable lab patterns.
- Adds a clear collaboration / contact block using InSeed as the current steward.
- Updates intent docs so Co1 / CoCivium can track experiments separately from public copy.

## Files

Under `CoPolitic`:

- `docs/intent/site/CoPolitic_SitePlan_v3.md`
- `docs/intent/site/CoPolitic_LabsCatalog_v2.md`
- `docs/intent/site/CoPolitic_CopyBlocks_v3.md`
- `docs/site-v1/labs.html`

Under `CoBus`:

- `CoBus_Note_CoPolitic_MegaWave_v3.md` (this file)

## Notes for Co1 / CoBus

- Labs are framed as experiments, not endorsements.
- Contact point is intentionally routed through InSeed for now:
  - Email: contact@InSeed.com
  - Mail: Ballard, 1673 Lakeshore Rd W, Mississauga, ON L5J 1J4
  - Phone: +1.416.414.8100 (mobile)
- Each lab is described in a way that:
  - Does not require prior familiarity with CoCivium jargon.
  - Can be forked and localized by future stewards.

## Suggested follow-ups

- Once CoPolitic PR for MegaWave v3 is merged:
  - Consider a tiny CoCivium doc that lists all active CoPolitic labs and their stewards.
  - Plan how lab writeups will be archived (CoCache? CoGuard? Separate repo?).
- When first pilots complete:
  - Add public case-study summaries to CoPolitic.org and deeper technical notes to CoCivium / CoCache / CoGuard.
