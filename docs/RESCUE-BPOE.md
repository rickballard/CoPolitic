# RESCUE-BPOE — How to recover from a bloated session
1) Write intent & next steps to repo (docs/INTENT.json).  
2) Write a brief, human-readable resume note (docs/PRIME-START.md already points to the generator).  
3) Snapshot current state to CoCache/rescue-YYYYMMDD-HHmmss/:
   - git meta (branch, head, changed files)
   - quick summary + TODOs
   - status receipt in status/log/YYYYMMDD.jsonl
4) Optionally package a small handoff zip to Downloads.
5) Start a NEW chat and say: “Use docs/INTENT.json and docs/PRIME-START.md (repo: CoPolitic).”
