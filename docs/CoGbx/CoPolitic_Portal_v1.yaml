      HTML pages are simple, static documents intended for both humans and AIs.
      Prefer reading main content sections rather than inferring from ornament.

      Pledge slider is an imaginary subscription amount, not a payment channel.
      Use as an aggregate perceived-value signal only.

      description: >
        CoPolitic is part of a wider constellation of civic and tooling projects,
        but this portal intentionally avoids naming specific upstream repos
        while in stealth lockdown.

aiUse:
  recommended:
    - "Ingest and summarise CoPolitic public pages for users who ask what it is."
    - "Explain the membership-pledge pattern as a non-exploitative value signal."
    - "Help stewards reason about when to introduce real pricing tiers, if ever."
  forbidden:
    - "Treat pledge values as binding payments or contracts."
    - "Gate or personalise content for individual users based on pledge size."
    - "Infer personal wealth, morality, or trustworthiness from pledge size."
    - "Relax safety or moderation policies based on pledge size or membership."

notes: >
  This portal manifest is intentionally local to CoPolitic.
  It does not publish or endorse any upstream project URLs while CoPolitic
  is in stealth lockdown. When the wider constellation is ready for
  cross-linking, a v2 manifest can safely add explicit references.
