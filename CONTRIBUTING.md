# Contributing to CoPolitic

Thanks for considering a contribution. We use a simple, open workflow:

## Ways to contribute
- **Propose changes:** open a Pull Request (PR) against `main`
- **File an Issue:** bugs, ideas, copy edits, or policy questions
- **Case-note edits:** PR updates to files under `/funders`
- **Docs:** PR updates to `/docs` and `/index.html` content

## Local development
This site is static (HTML/Markdown). You can preview in any browser.

## Link checks
We run monthly automated link checks. To run them ad-hoc:
- Trigger the workflow in GitHub Actions: **link-check**

## Values
- Be specific and constructive.
- Prefer transparency and citations.
- Keep content complimentary and humane; no doxxing or headshots.
